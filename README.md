# Acrostic-Puzzle-Writer
A desktop application to assist the acrostic puzzle writer in creating new acrostic puzzles.
This is a work in progress, so don't get too excited unless you want to create a new branch and pitch in to help write this.

The APW is a desktop application (which will still work even after the EMP has taken down the internet) written in Python 3 in cooperation with AI.  The AI writes the code to spec and I get it working, including debugging its mistakes.

What I DON'T do is go off on my own and start writing fixes and extensions.  I keep AI in the form of ChatGPT involved at every step of the way, so when I need help I can ask for it and the AI can offer suggestions and code snippets to bail me out.

The APW is written OO-style.  This makes it easier to keep things sorted and to make specific references to AI when I want it to write method implementations and such.
Please stick with the OO-style when making changes and/or additions.
